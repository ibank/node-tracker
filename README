BitTorrent Tracker implemented with node.js

  It was initially implemented in two days on Saint-Petersburg's HackDay #9
  event. Later code was cleaned up.

  It is still in raw prototype stage, but it seems that announces are handled
  correctly for both compact and default modes.

    $ node lib/tracker.js
